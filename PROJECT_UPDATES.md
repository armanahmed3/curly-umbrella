# Project Section Updates

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. **Filter Functionality - NOW WORKING**
- Added JavaScript filter logic in `assets/js/script.js`
- Each project card now has a `data-category` attribute
- Filter buttons are fully functional

**Categories:**
- All Projects (shows all)
- E-commerce (4 projects)
- Management Systems (3 projects)
- SaaS Applications (2 projects)
- Web Development (3 projects)

### 2. **Unique AI-Generated Images**
Created 12 unique SVG images with modern gradients for each project:

| Project | Image File | Category |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| E-commerce UK | project-ecommerce-uk.jpg | E-commerce |
| Umrah Travel | project-umrah-travel.jpg | Web Development |

| E-commerce USA | project-ecommerce-usa.jpg | E-commerce |
| Skin Care | project-skincare.jpg | E-commerce |

| Printing Management | project-printing-management.jpg | Management Systems |
| AI Job Analyzer | project-ai-job-analyzer.jpg | SaaS Applications |
| Lead Gen Pro | project-lead-gen-pro.jpg | SaaS Applications |

### 3. **How the Filter Works**
1. Click any filter button (E-commerce, Management Systems, etc.)
2. JavaScript reads the button text
3. Compares with each project's `data-category` attribute
4. Shows matching projects, hides non-matching ones
5. "All Projects" button shows everything

### 4. **All Project Links Are Working**
Every project card links to the actual live website or demo provided.
